Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project. Use the following command to create a new React project using Create React App:
```npx create-react-app <APP NAME>```
Start the development server:
```npm start```
In case this does not work try using this first (It will install all the dependencies from the package.json file):
```npm install```
